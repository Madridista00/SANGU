Message used:
"Sangu is the best professor in best university"

=== Signature Verification Process (Bob's point of view) ===

1. Bob receives the file: signed_and_encrypted.asc
   This file contains:
   • The original plaintext message (encrypted with Bob's public key)
   • A digital signature created by Alice using her private key

2. Bob runs:
   gpg --decrypt signed_and_encrypted.asc > decrypted_message.txt

3. During decryption GPG automatically performs these steps:

   a) Decryption phase (confidentiality)
      • Uses Bob's private key to decrypt the session key
      • Uses the session key to decrypt the actual message

   b) Signature verification phase (authenticity + integrity)
      • Extracts Alice's embedded digital signature from the .asc file
      • Extracts Alice's public key (already imported into Bob's keyring)
      • Re-computes the cryptographic hash (SHA-256 by default in modern GPG) of the decrypted plaintext
      • Uses Alice's public key to decrypt the signature → recovers the original hash that Alice computed
      • Compares the two hashes

4. Result shown on screen:
   gpg: Good signature from "Alice <alice@university.local>" [ultimate]
   gpg: Signature made ...
   Primary key fingerprint: XXXX XXXX ...

Meaning:
- "Good signature" = the hash Alice computed matches the hash Bob just computed
- Therefore the message has not been altered (integrity guaranteed)
- The signature could only have been created by the holder of Alice's private key (non-repudiation)
- Since Bob trusts Alice's public key → Bob now trusts that the message genuinely came from Alice

Conclusion:
The digital signature successfully validates that the sender is Alice and that the message content is exactly what Alice sent.
