# Task 3 – TLS Communication Inspection & Analysis (8/8 points)

Website analyzed: https://www.google.com (November 2025)

1. openssl s_client output (see screenshots/openssl_google.png & openssl_details.png)
   • TLS version       : TLS 1.3
   • Cipher suite      : TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   • Key exchange      : ECDHE with X25519

2. Certificate chain (Root → Intermediate → Leaf)
   • Leaf           : *.google.com (Google Trust Services)
   • Intermediate   : GTS CA 1C3
   • Root           : GlobalSign Root CA - R1

3. Wireshark capture highlights (see screenshots/)
   • Client Hello               → screenshot: wireshark_client_hello.png
   • Server Certificate         → screenshot: wireshark_server_certificate.png

4. How TLS provides confidentiality and integrity
   • Confidentiality: After handshake derives fresh symmetric keys → all traffic after Server Finished is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   • Integrity & authenticity: Every TLS record has an AEAD tag (GCM). The entire handshake transcript is signed by the server’s private key.
