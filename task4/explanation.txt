Task 4B: Real-Life Applications of Diffie-Hellman

Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange is widely used in secure communication to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel without prior key sharing. In the TLS handshake (used in HTTPS), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) is employed to generate unique session keys for each connection, ensuring that even if a server's private key is later compromised, past communications remain secure — a property known as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). In secure messaging protocols like the Signal Protocol (used by Signal and WhatsApp), an extended version called X3DH combines multiple DH exchanges to provide initial key agreement with authentication and deniability, even in asynchronous scenarios. Diffie-Hellman is essential for secure communication because it allows two parties to agree on a secret key in the presence of eavesdroppers, resists man-in-the-middle attacks when properly authenticated, and enables forward secrecy, making it a cornerstone of modern internet security.
